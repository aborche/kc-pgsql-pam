possible.

## Commits

Commit messages should be well formatted, and to make that "standardized", we
are using Conventional Commits.

```shell

  <type>[<scope>]: <short summary>
     │      │             │
     │      │             └─> Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No
     |      |                 period at the end. 
     │      │
     │      └─> Scope (optional): eg. common, compiler, authentication, core
     │
     └─> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
